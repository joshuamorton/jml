# Machine Learning for Juggling

A collection of experiments at the cross section of machine learning and
juggling of all things. The intent is for these to be well documented, cool, and
easily reproducible.

## Installation

jml is managed via [pipenv](https://github.com/kennethreitz/pipenv), a modern
python project management tool. It uses python 3.4.3+.
